<p>After spotting on the MALDI plates , samples are allowed to dry for 30 min . Then the instrument is switched om and the MS analysis is performed according to the following steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on " Launchpad" and then open "Kompact software".</li>
<li>Go to instrument.</li>
<li>Open " Aquisition Window".</li>
<li>Click on "Exp. Tech".</li>
<li>Click on "Open Door".</li>
</ol>

<ol><ol>
<li>Insert the MALDI target plate (face up with the cut - off corner to the front ).</li>
<li>In Exp. Tech , click close door.</li>
<li>Allow it to create vaccum.</li>
<li>In Exp. Tech windows : Linear or Reflectron , depending on sample (for less than 10,000 amu use reflectron mode).</li>
<li>Set the mass range e.g. 10-5000Da.</li>
<li>Then go to firing tab , set the power to 50 , profiles 1000 ns shots to 2.</li>

<ol>
<li>Set the "Ion gate" OFF { for post -source decay (PSD) analysis ion gat should be kept on }.</li>
<li>Then right click on the yellow target in the Aquisition window and " select go to location " and type the location of pep-mix , e.g. D1.</li>
<li>Click on "processing" from main tab then "peak processing". Set typically smoothing off (for PSD it is average ) and select baseline subtraction.</li>
<li>Click on "Monoisotopic peak" .Select "All display" and click "Apply to".</li>
<li>Click on "Fire" . During the aquisition , Check the resolution of the highest mass standard peak.</li>
<li>To check the resolution during an aquisition , click "suspend" to pause the aquisition. When the resolution has been measured , click " resume" to continue the aquisition . For peptide standard ACTH fragment 18-19 (m/z 2465.20), the rsolution should be &gt; 5000 . If resolution is much lower then reduce the laser power to improve resolution.</li>
<li>Move the target to find a " Sweet Spot ". Use clear data button to restart the accumulation once a satisfactory position has bee found on the sample spot.</li>
<li>Once a satisfactory spectrum is obtained , click " Abort " to stop aquisition.</li>
<li>Click " Store " to save the spectrum .</li>
<li>In calibration window create a calibration file . Insert the mass of calibration standards , calibrate and save it.</li>
<li>Now go to " Location " . Type the location for sample . And Click of " FIRE" and Look for a sweet spot for sample by moving the cursor . Once a satisfactory spectrum has been obtained , click " Abort and Store" to stop and save the spectrum.</li>
<li>Result of the MALDI-TOF analysis can be saved either as ASCII files or the mass pick list can be saved manually. Further data - base analysis for identification of the protein has been disscussed in Exp. 7.</li>
