<p>Bioinformatics is an amalgamation of two major disciplines of science; the Biological and Computer sciences which includes developing databases to store and catalogue information, tools and algorithms to analyze and evaluate this information, and the designing softwares that can apply statistical techniques and theories to solve problems such as protein structure prediction, in silico. The need for Bioinformatics was realized when Human Genome Project was initiated, which aimed to sequence the entire human genome. Since then, it has grown to encompass proteomics, transcriptomics, molecular modeling and several other disciplines in its fold. Today, bioinformatics has become indispensible to biological scientists. One can no longer think of cataloguing a gene or protein sequence manually. Its automation and swift actions envisages a great deal of precision and has made the work simpler. Some of its applications include sequence prediction and alignment, phylogenetic analysis, homology modeling, high-throughput analysis and systems biology. Many universities, government institutions and pharmaceutical companies have come forward to form bioinformatics groups to carry out research pertaining to computational biology aspects to develop better algorithms and improvise the existing processes.</p>

<p>Proteomics is the study of the entire protein compliment of a cell, tissue or an organism at a particular time or given conditions of stress. It involves the study of individual proteins, protein-protein interactions, active site prediction and functional proteomics. Studying the protein compliment of the cell is much more complex as compared to its genomics as the genome more or less remains constant but their expression changes every moment depending upon the stress and the requirements of the cell and the surroundings. Thus, it generates large amounts of data pertaining to protein structures, properties, functions, active sites, 3D conformations, etc, which is impossible to be maintained manually and retrieval also becomes tedious and time consuming. Bioinformatics makes it easier to come up with new algorithms to handle the large and heterogeneous datasets involved in these studies and also works to constantly improvise the algorithms involved.</p>
<br />
<p>Various algorithms have been developed to analyze protein structure and function, active site residues, identify interacting ligands, proteolytic and glycosalation sites, etc. Various algorithms for image analysis of 2D gels, analyzing the expression profile of proteins have also been developed.</p>
