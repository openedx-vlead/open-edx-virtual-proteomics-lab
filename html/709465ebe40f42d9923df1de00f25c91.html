<p><strong>2.A. Rehydration of IPG strips:</strong></p>
<p>Commercially available IPG strips contain the polyacrylamide gel in its dehydrated form. The strips therefore need to be rehydrated before they can be loaded with the protein sample. This is done by placing the strip in the rehydration tray containing the rehydration solution, overnight, for about 10-12 h. This enables efficient absorption of proteins on the gel. The procedure for strip rehydration is as follows:</p>
<ul type="circle">
<li>The rehydration solution containing 8 M urea and 4% CHAPS/TRITON X100 is prepared. The components are mixed well and stored at -20&deg;C.</li>
<li>5 &micro;l of the required IPG buffer and 6.2 mg of DTT are added just prior to use to 1 mL of the rehydration solution and the components mixed thoroughly by vortex.</li>
<li>The rehydration tray is cleaned thoroughly, and the dry lanes are loaded with the rehydration buffer.</li>
<li>The IPG strip to be rehydrated is selected and the protective cover that is present on it is removed carefully using forceps.</li>
<li>Each IPG strip has two sides; a base which is made of plastic and the other side having the gel on it.</li>
<li>The IPG strip is then carefully placed into the lane using forceps such that the surface with gel faces downwards and gets maximum contact with the solution around it.</li>
<li>The set-up is then left undisturbed for about 20-30 min.</li>
<li>Mineral oil is applied on the set-up to avoid the drying of gels. It is advisable to apply mineral oil to two adjacent lanes so as to supplement uniformity of oil.</li>
<li>The set-up is left on the working bench for 15 hours.</li>
<li>The manifold of the IEF instrument is then cleaned and placed on an even surface to prepare for focusing.</li>
<li>The IPG strips are removed from the rehydration tray with the help of forceps and the ends are gently dabbed over an absorbent tissue to remove any excess mineral oil.</li>
<li>The strip is then carefully placed in the fresh tray, with the gel side facing upwards. Wicks are then placed on each end of the gel and other wells are filled with fresh mineral oil.</li>
<li>Electrodes are carefully placed over the assembly and the desired programme with suitable voltage gradient over time intervals is set to start the focusing.</li>
<li>The voltage gradients and time intervals are decided based on the strip being used and the sample being run. Optimization of these critical parameters is required to get best resolution in the first dimension. The programme can end with a holding step which works on a low voltage for stipulated amount of time.</li>
<li>The separation can be monitored real-time. The wick in use may need to be changed in middle of experiment if its color changes to yellow. This coloring of the wick takes place because of the excess salts and impurities that may be present in the sample.</li>
<li>Once focusing is complete, the strips are taken out of the tray and the ends gently dabbed on the surface of an absorbent tissue to remove excess oil.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. B Equilibration of strips:</strong></p>
<p>The isoelectrically focused strips must be equilibrated before they are separated in their second dimension. This step ensures proper denaturation of proteins, which in turn enables efficient separation based on molecular weight during SDS-PAGE. Dithiothreitol (DTT) is used for reduction of inter and intra-chain disulfide bonds in proteins. Iodoacetamide, (IAA) being a potent alkylating agent, prevents the reformation of these broken disulfide bonds by alkylating the sulphur atoms.</p>
<p>The equilibration solution consisting of 6 M urea, 75 mM tris HCl buffer, 29.3% glycerol, 2% SDS and 0.02% bromophenol blue, made up to 20 mL using distilled water, is prepared. The contents are thoroughly mixed and can be stored at -20&deg;C for later use. Just before use, 10 mg of DTT is added to 10 mL of the equilibration solution to obtain solution X and 25 mg of iodoacetamide is added to the remaining 10 mL of the equilibration solution to prepare solution Y.</p>
<p>First, solution X is taken in a container and the focussed strip is placed for around 10 min treatment. Next, the strip is transferred to solution Y where it remains for another 10 min, thereby completing the last step of focusing. The strip is then ready for separation in the second dimension.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 13.</strong>&nbsp;Equilibration of proteins on IPG strips before transfer to second dimension. The focused strip is treated with equilibration buffer 1 for 15 min and transferred to equilibration buffer 2 for another 15 min, finally on to the SDS-PAGE gel, sealed with agarose to prepare for the run.</p>
<p><strong>3. Second dimension - Separation on SDS-PAGE</strong></p>
<p>SDS-PAGE, which separates proteins on the basis of their molecular weight, constitutes the second dimension of 2-DE after isoelectric focusing. The gels used for the 2D run must be casted and kept ready at least half an hour so that there is sufficient time for proper gel polymerization. The concentration and size of the gel vary based on the sample being separated and the dimensions of the IPG strip used during first dimension, separation. The commonly used and preferable gel concentration is 12.5%. The IPG strip containing the separated proteins, being very sleek and fragile, must be placed carefully and firmly in contact with the SDS-PAGE gel, such that there are no air gaps between the two surfaces that could allow the protein to escape. To facilitate this process, an agarose solution is often used as a fixing agent, which helps in removing any air bubbles that may be formed. Bromophenol blue (BPB), which is added to the agarose solution, acts as a tracking dye for the experiment to view the electrophoretic migration at any given time. The detailed protocol is as follows:</p>
<ul type="circle">
<li>First, the appropriately sized gel casting apparatus is assembled together.</li>
<li>Next, the following components are prepared and mixed together for casting the gel (indicated contents are optimum for casting an 11 cm gel):</li>
<li>Acrylamide bis-Acrylamide solution (29:1 ratio) -3.14 mL</li>
<li>Distilled water-3.685 mL</li>
<li>Tris-HCl (pH 8.8)-2.435 mL</li>
<li>SDS (10%)-93.75 &micro;L</li>
<li>APS (10%)-93.75 &micro;L</li>
<li>TEMED-3.75 &micro;L</li>
</ul>
<p>A 10X stock solution of the buffers required for the gel tanks are prepared by mixing the following:</p>
<p>Tris base (FW 121.1) 250 mM&mdash;30.3 g<br />Glycine (FW 75.07) 192 mM&mdash;144.1 g<br />SDS (FW 288.38) 0.1% (w/v)--10 g<br />Double-distilled water to--1 L<br />This 10X stock solution can be diluted to 1X strength before use (100 ml made up to 1000ml).</p>
<p>Acrylamide Bis-Acrylamide solution together form polymer and form the bases of the gel. SDS helps for providing uniform negative charge on the protein surface which helps for movement proteins in PAGE depending on molecular weight regardless of charge. APS along with TEMED will form free radicals which help in polymerization of gels. Note that the TEMED can be added just before pouring the gel.</p>
<ul type="circle">
<li>Add all the contents mentioned above. Mix it thoroughly.</li>
<li>Slowly pour the gel through the sides of the plates by making contact with the sides to avoid the formation of air bubble.</li>
<li>Keep in mind that a small space has to be left for placing the IPG strip and pouring agarose solution on the top.</li>
<li>Once the gel is poured immediately pour a small quantity of water with 0.1% SDS on top. This maintains a uniform surface for placing the IPG strip.</li>
<li>Gel takes approximately 35-40 min to polymerize.</li>
<li>Mean while prepare 0.75% agarose solution with 0.02% of BPB in water. Mix the content and warm to dissolve the content. After dissolution cool it a bit so that it is optimum to pour.</li>
<li>Decant the water on gel carefully remove the remaining water with the help of absorbent tissue paper.</li>
<li>Carefully take equilibrated IPG strip, place on the gel so that the strip ensure proper contact of strip with gel</li>
<li>Carefully pour the agarose solution till the top mark and allow it to solidify.</li>
<li>Place the set-up inside the tank of electrophoresis and pour the tank buffer into inner and outer tank.</li>
<li>Apply constant voltage of 90 volts. The procedure approximately takes 2-3 h for separation.</li>
<li>The electric supply can be stopped when the dye front reaches the end of the gel or slightly moves out of the gel.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>4) Gel staining and data analysis</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. A: Staining and destaining</strong></p>
<p>Once the proteins are separated on SDS PAGE, to visualize the separation patterns, proteins need to be stained. Stains are chemical components which specifically bind to proteins enabling the visualization. The property of dye should be such that it helps visualization of maximum number of protein spots on gel with high amount of sensitivity.</p>
<p>Coomassie brilliant blue is most widely used stain. There are some more varieties such as silver staining, sypro ruby etc. Depending up on sensitivity and cost effectiveness the selection can be done unlike stains of silver do interfere at protein identification during MS The sensitivity of silver is ten-fold more as compared to coomassie in visualizing proteins at lower concentration. So selection of the dye, depending upon the requirement is a user call.</p>
<p>Image of stained gel can be taken using gel documentation instrument which will typically have a chamber and a detector for capturing image. Comparison of the global expression profiling or differential expression of proteins within or across the gel can be done with the help of commercially available software.</p>
<p>Staining procedures are as follows; Preparation of coomassie dye; Methanol, acetic acid and distilled water are mixed in 40:7:53 ratios. To same 350mg Coomassie Blue is added. The solution is mixed well and can be filtered using a filter paper to get rid of un-dissolved debris. Though the stain is mostly used once, it can be used thrice efficiently. The gel after removing and before staining has to be washed with distilled water. This helps the removal of SDS which may hinder the proper staining of the gel by forming streaks all over the gels.</p>
<ul type="circle">
<li>Carefully remove the gel out of the gel plates.</li>
<li>Place the gel into container with distilled water; wash the gels briefly at least thrice by changing water. Then discard the water used.</li>
<li>Now immerse the gel in stain solution, cover the container, and keep it on gel rocker with a constant shacking for about 6-8 h.</li>
<li>The stain covers the whole gel including the parts without proteins. Hence the gels have to be distained so that only the part with proteins will retain the stain and rest of the background is clear.</li>
<li>Take the gel out of stain and immerse in distaining solution (40:7:53 methanol, acetic acid, water) for about 5-6 h. Change the stain about three times for efficient destining.</li>
<li>The stained gel can be washed with distilled water twice before imaging.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>4. B: Imaging and analysis</strong></p>
<p>Once the proteins are separated over 2DE, each spot on gel represents unique protein/proteins specific to particular pI and molecular weight. Perhaps protein spots on the gel can be interpreted in various ways depending upon the user&rsquo;s application. If the user wishes to have application such as global protein expression profiling or differential expression profiling it is tough to do so manually for there are enormous numbers of protein spots over a gel and manual interpretation may lead into an erroneous result. Hence the gels can be analyzed with the aid of commercially available software, which will enable user to compare the expression profiles of proteins within and across the gels. Software uses unique way of reading pixel intensities for implying the quantity of the proteins. Analysis gives a comprehensive output in statistical terms which are often easy to interpret and can be extended to a wider biological scenario.</p>
<p>The gel is placed carefully on the imaging platform. Care should be taken to ensure that the gel does not break while transferring.The gel image is captured and saved with appropriate label. Image analysis is performed for checking the differential expression between two different samples with the help of commercially available software packages. These software&rsquo;s have tools which allow gels to be cropped, overlayed, zoomed into, edited, later matched, compared with, derive statistical data for the analysis. Although there are several tools which need to be explored in detail with the software, the basic steps for image analysis is as follows:</p>
<ul type="circle">
<li>A suitable labeled master folder is first created which should contain the gels to be analyzed. The gel images to be analyzed are imported, opened on the software and labeled appropriately.</li>
<li>The region on the gel having maximum spot density is selected and the gel is cropped with the cropping tool so that regions without spots are excluded from the analysis.</li>
<li>The spots on the gel can be selected with the help of the spot picking tool on the software. These spots are selected by the software on the basis of certain user-defined criteria, which gets translated by the software into pixel intensities of the spots.</li>
<li>The gel can be zoomed into and carefully analyzed to detect spots that may have been selected based on the defined criteria to retain actually protein spots. This step is very important because the selected spots will be considered for comparison across the gels. Therefore great care must be taken not to select a wrong spot and more importantly, not to miss an important protein spot.</li>
<li>The selected spots are then matched across gels. This process displays the number of spots that are matched and unmatched across the gels.</li>
<li>The extent of matching can also be seen with a 3-D graphical representation of the spots.</li>
<li>The spot parameters such as volume, intensity, possible pI, molecular weight etc. can be obtained through the software.</li>
<li>Statistical parameters of spot matching across different gels such as coefficient of variation, standard deviation, t-test values etc. can also be obtained.</li>
<li>All this data can be compiled together to understand the differential expression of proteins across the desired gels.</li>
