<p>In case of determination of the accurate mass of the intact proteins, the extracted protein is mixed with suitable matrix solution in a microcentrifuge tube, mixed properly and the uniform mixture is deposited directly on the MALDI plate. Spotting can also be accomplished using the sandwich method (Details of the protocol is provided in Experiment 5). After drying, the plate is inserted in MALDI instrument and analysis is performed. The instrument operation is same as described under Experiment 6, expect the linear mode is selected instead of reflectron mode. Result of the MALDI-TOF analysis is saved either as ASCII files or the accurate mass of the protein is determined from the pick position.</p>

<li>In Exp. Tech window select tuning mode : Linear mode</li>
</ul>
</ol><ol>
<ul>
<li>Set the mass range e.g. 10-100000 Da(depending upon the protein sample).</li>
</ul>
</ol><ol>
<ul>
<li>Then go to fining tab . Set the power to 50 , profiles to 1000 and shots to 2.</li>
</ul>
</ol><ol>
<ul>
<li>Set the "Ion gate" OFF (for (PSD ion gate should be kept on).</li>
</ul>
</ol><ol>
<ul>
<li>Then right click on the yellow target in the Acquisition window and select go to Location and type the location of pep-mix. e.g. D1.</li>
</ul>
</ol><ol>
<ul>
<li>Click on "processing" then peak processing " . Typically Smoothing is off (for PSDit is average ) and Baseline subtraction is used.</li>
</ul>
</ol><ol>
<ul>
<li>Click on "Monoisotopic peak" . select " All display" and click " Apply to ".</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Click on "Fire".During acquisition , check the resolution of the higest mass standard peaks.</li>
</ul>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<ul>
<li>To check the reolution during an acquisition, click "suspend" to pause the aquisition . When the resolution has been measured , click "Resume" to continue the aquisition . For peptide standard ACTH fragment 18-19 (m/z 2465.20), the resolution should be &gt;5,000. If resolution is much lower then reduce the laser power to improve resolution.</li>
