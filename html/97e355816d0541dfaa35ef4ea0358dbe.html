<h4>Instructors&rsquo; assignment:</h4>
<p>Course instructors should explain the basic theory of MALDI-TOF and play the animation in class before providing the detail experiment protocol. Once the students become familiar with the overall procedure they can be evaluated through the related questions provided under &ldquo;Quiz&rdquo; and &ldquo;Assignment&rdquo; sections.</p>
<h4>Assignment for students:</h4>
<p>Students should click on the simulator window to run the animation and there are provisions for the learners to participate actively in the over-all MALDI-TOF instrumentation process by clicking on the equipments, computer screen etc. using interactive animations during the different steps of the instrumentation process. Students are strongly advised to go through the references provided in &ldquo;Reference&rdquo; section for further knowledge.</p>
