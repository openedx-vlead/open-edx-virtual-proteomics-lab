<h4>Instructors&rsquo; assignment:</h4>
<p>Course instructors should explain the basic theory behind in-gel digestion and play the animation in class before providing them detailed experiment protocol. Once the students become familiar with the overall procedure they can be evaluated through the related questions provided under &ldquo;Quiz&rdquo; and &ldquo;Assignment&rdquo; sections.</p>
<br />
<h4>Assignment for students:</h4>
<p>Students can click on simulator window to run the animation and there are provisions for the learners to participate actively for over-all in-gel digestion process by using interactive animations. Students can click on micropipettes, reagents, equipments etc. using the computer mouse during different steps of the experiment. Students are strongly advised to go through the references provided in &ldquo;Reference&rdquo; section to further advance their knowledge.</p>
