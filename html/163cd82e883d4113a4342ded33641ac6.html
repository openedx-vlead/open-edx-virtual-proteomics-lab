<p><strong>1.B- Sonication of serum proteins</strong></p>
<p>Biological fluids like serum are extremely complex and have a wide variety of proteins, which can hinder the separation in 2-DE. In order to improve the quality of protein extraction, various physical methods and chemical methods have been developed which reduce the complexity of the crude serum sample. Sonication of serum protein is one of the widely used physical methods to distort cell complex and its inter- and intra- protein interactions. In this process, high frequency sound waves are applied to the crude samples for a short exposure,which help in disrupting the cells. Procedure for sonication of the crude serum sample is as follows:</p>
<ul type="circle">
<li>A fresh, clean, autoclaved microcentrifuge tube is taken and 200 &micro;L of serum is pipette into it.</li>
<li>The serum is then diluted five times using Phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, after which the contents are mixed thoroughly by vortex for 30 sec.</li>
<li>The sample is then sonicated for 6 cycles of 5 sec pulse with a 59 sec gap in between each cycle at 20% amplitude.</li>
<li>Since the process of sonication generates a large amount of heat, one must ensure that the sample tube is always kept immersed in an ice bucket to avoid any denaturation or spoiling of the sample.</li>
<li>Do apply ear plugs while doing the experiment, since the sounds bursts may cause some serious damage to ears.</li>

<p><strong>Figure 8.</strong>Sonication of serum protein sample, required quantity of buffer is added to the sample. The probe is made to submerge into the sample solution; the tube is placed on the ice and sound waves are exposed for short time to carry out sonication.</p>
<p><strong>1.C- Protein Precipitation using Acetone</strong></p>
<p>In this process, acetone is used to precipitate out proteins from the solution, while ethanol is used as a washing agent. Addition of ice-cold acetone to the sample brings about precipitation of proteins from the solution, while the lipids, impurities and any detergents that may be present remain in the supernatant. The precipitated proteins are then harvested by centrifugation and the pellet containing desired proteins is washed with ethanol to remove any organic contaminants that may be present in the sample. (Note: Acetone to be used for precipitation must be kept for at least 5 h at -20&deg;C before use). The pellet obtained after centrifugation is then rehydrated using rehydration solution having the following composition:</p>
<ul type="circle">
<li>8 mM Urea: Urea, being a chaotropic agent, helps in stabilization and unfolding of proteins so that the protein&rsquo;s charged surfaces are exposed towards the solution.</li>
<li>2% w/v CHAPS {3-[(3-cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate}: This is a zwitterionic detergent used for solubilizing proteins.</li>
<li>40 mM DTT (Dithiothreitol): DTT efficiently reduces inter and intra molecular disulphide interactions thereby exposing the ionic surfaces of the proteins.</li>
<li>12 &micro;L TBP (Tributylphosphine): TBP is a reducing agent which increases solubility of the protein. Due to its non-ionic nature, TBP does not migrate in the Immobilized pH gradient (IPG) strip during first dimension separation and therefore helps in maintaining reducing conditions.</li>
<li>IPG buffer: This buffer is added in accordance with the IPG strip that is to be used for first dimension separation.</li>
<li>All these chemicals are mixed to prepare the rehydration solution, aliquots of which is prepared and stored at -20&deg;C for future use.</li>
</ul>
<p>The detailed procedure for protein precipitation using acetone is as follows:</p>
<ul type="circle">
<li>1 ml of pre-processed serum is first divided into 5 parts, each containing 200 &micro;L. Each sample is then mixed with 4 times the volume of acetone (800 &micro;L). This turns the solution turbid, indicating the precipitation of proteins. The tubes are vortexed for about 15 sec to ensure proper mixing.</li>
<li>These tubes are then stored at -20&deg;C for 6 h for incubation.</li>
<li>After this, the tubes are centrifuged at 1000 g for 15 min at 40&deg;C. This helps in complete precipitation of proteins and formation of pellet.</li>
</ul>

<ul type="circle">
<li>Carefully discard the supernatant, and add about 200 &micro;L of ethanol for washing the pellet. Vortex the tube for 20 sec.</li>
<li>Centrifuge the tube at 5000 g for 10 min at 40&deg;C. This separates the supernatant and forms a pellet of protein. The supernatant is discarded and the same step is repeated once more.</li>
<li>The pellet obtained is allowed to dry for about 15 min at room temperature. Since acetone is a highly volatile the excess of it evaporates leaving the pellet dry.</li>
<li>Rehydrate dry pellet using 100 &micro;L rehydration solution. The tubes are vortexed to ensure proper re-suspension. If required about 20&micro;L more of rehydration solution can be added to re-dissolve all the suspended particles.</li>
<li>Finally all the re-dissolved fractions of respective samples are pooled to make a single aliquot. This can be readily used for further work or can be stored in -20&deg;C.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1.D: Removal of high abundant proteins:</strong></p>
<p>Commercially available serum depletion kits contain affinity chromatography based columns along with relevant buffer solutions and collection tubes. The procedure for removal of high abundance proteins involves 2 major steps - column preparation and protein binding with elution.</p>
<p><strong>(a) Column preparation:</strong>Commercially available kits are provided along with chromatography bead slurry, which is either given separately such that the column must be carefully packed by the user; or in the form of a packed, ready-to-use column.</p>
<ul type="circle">
<li>The column needs to be activated to bring in the proper charged surfaces to facilitate the binding of desired proteins. This is done by passing the column with stipulated amount of activation buffer provided with the kit.</li>
<li>Once the column is applied with the activation buffer and fixed with collection tube it is centrifuged with recommended time and RPM.</li>
<li>The collected wash is discarded and the procedure is repeated.</li>
<li>Care should be taken to ensure proper activation of the affinity beads with the buffer resulting in proper binding of the proteins</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>b) Protein binding and Elution:</strong>&nbsp;In this step, the desired proteins are bound on the column matrix by spinning the column with the protein sample. The chemistry of the column is such that the abundant proteins bind to the surface of beads containing specific affinity agents that capture the proteins. The unbound proteins (proteins of our interest), on the other hand, elute out of the column. Therefore it is very crucial step to collect the unbound proteins in a fresh, clean tube and store them under proper conditions for further use.</p>
<ul type="circle">
<li>The column is first loaded with the recommended amount of protein sample, after which it is incubated for specified time duration in order to facilitate proper binding.</li>
<li>The column in then centrifuged with a fresh collection tube at the outlet and the collected flow-through is stored and labeled as flow through (F1).This fraction contains proteins of our interest i.e serum deprived of high abundance proteins.</li>
<li>Next, the column is washed with the provided wash buffer by passing a specified volume of buffer into the column. It is centrifuged to collect the flow-through (F2) in a separate tube. This fraction contains loosely bound proteins, which were not eluted out on the first attempt.</li>
<li>The fractions, F2 and F1, can then be mixed to make a whole fraction of serum containing most of the low-abundance proteins.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1. E: Desalting:</strong></p>
<p>Serum not only contains proteins but also constitute other components such as nucleic acids, lipids, detergents, salts from buffers used etc. These can hinder the overall process of protein separation in the first dimension, which depends on charge of the proteins, and also in the second dimension by forming streaks in the gel image. Therefore, the sample should ideally be depleted of any other charged components in order to obtain better separation of spots. This can also be done with the help of commercially available kits. The principle involved is similar to that of acetone or TCA precipitation of proteins.</p>
<ul type="circle">
<li>The precipitating agent in the kit is added to the protein solution, which selectively precipitates out the proteins and leaves other unwanted ionic impurities in solution.</li>
<li>The precipitated proteins can be separated from the supernatant with the help of centrifugation.</li>
<li>The protein pellet remaining after pipetting out the supernatant is then re-suspended in a rehydration buffer.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>1. F: Quantitation:</strong></p>
<p>Quantification of proteins in a sample is a crucial step for 2-DE since every IPG strip has an specified optimal protein intake capacity. It is also important to load similar protein quantities on different gels so that comparison across gels is feasible. This also helps in avoiding experimental artifacts and allows analysis of the gel in a biological context. The protein estimation method should be selected in such a way that the reagents used for the method must be compatible with other added chemicals and must not interfere in the 1D and 2D separations.</p>
<p>The modified Bradford method is conventionally used by many researchers due to the ready availability of reagents in the market and ease of use. The Bradford reagent contains Coomassie Brillient blue G-250 dye, which is initially brownish red in color and eventually changes to a blue color with protein binding, which can be read at 595nm.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>The sample concentration will depend on the range of the standards used. If the sample concentration is above the limit of reading of colorimeter, then the sample must be diluted and assay must be repeated. Finally, the result must be multiplied by the dilution factor to obtain the original undiluted protein concentration. If, on the other hand, the concentration is below the lowest standard, reduce the standard concentration to carry out the assay.</p>
<p><strong>2. First dimension - Isoelectric focusing</strong></p>
<p>Isoelectric focusing constitutes the first dimension separation in 2-D electrophoresis. This technique separates proteins on the basis of their respective isoelectric points (pI) i.e the pH at which the net charge on the protein is zero. Focusing is carried out with the help of commercially available Immobilized pH Gradient (IPG) strips on which, the proteins move under the influence of an electric field until their net charge is zero and get focused at their particular pI.</p>
<p>IPG strips are solid surfaces on which dehydrated polyacrylamide is coated. The different derivatives of acrylamide having a range of pKa values are found across the gel, which enables separation of proteins in the first dimension. These commercial strips are available in a range of pH gradients such as 4-7, 3-10, 4-11 etc. as well as, in a variety of lengths starting from 7, 11, 13, 18 and 24cm. The user can choose the strip based on the protein separation across the length and pH requirements in a particular experiment. The strips are rehydrated either with only rehydration buffer prior to protein loading or incase suitable protein concentration along with rehydration buffer can be used. The IPG strips are then soaked with rehydration solution for overnight as in for passive rehydration or by applying current for active rehydration. The focusing is carried out on an instrument that enables gradient supply of electric current to the IPG strips. Once the proteins have been resolved in the first dimension, the strips are loaded on the SDS-PAGE gel to proceed with second dimension separation.&nbsp;<br />The detailed procedure for isoelectric focusing can be subdivided into following categories:</p>
