<p>LigPlot Analysis - After the docking results are obtained, the interaction can be studied using program like LigPlot that automatically plot ligand-protein interactions. Here, the ligand bound protein is used as the input file to generate the 2D plot of the hydrogen bond interaction and also the hydrophobic interaction. The docking score and the LigPlot analysis are the two most important analyses for selection of the best fit. The following is the good example of a good interaction.</p>
