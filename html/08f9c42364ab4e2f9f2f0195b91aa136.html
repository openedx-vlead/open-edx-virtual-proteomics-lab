<p><strong>2.1 Advantages of 2DE over 1DE</strong></p>
<p>Initially proteins were separated by one-dimensional electrophoresis using molecular size as the separation criteria with smaller proteins migrating further along the gel than the larger ones. However, separation on the basis of only MW of the proteins was unable to provide comprehensive resolution of complex biological samples like serum, cell lysates, plant tissues etc. due to the complexity of the samples and presence of several protein molecules with similar or nearly similar molecular masses. To this end, in early 1956, Smithies and Poulik recognized a new approach in which a combination of two electrophoretic processes was carried out on gels at right angles to each other for better separation than single dimension run. The concept of 2DE was developed and established by O&rsquo;Farrell in the year of 1975, which became rapidly accepted and adopted by many researchers as an extremely useful technique to study complex mixtures of proteins. As the name suggests, proteins are separated in 2DE based on two different properties - isolectric point (pI) in the first dimension and molecular weight (MW) in second dimension giving better resolution of hundreds to thousands of proteins in a single gel. In the year of 1977, 2DE approach was successfully employed for the first time by Anderson and Anderson for the analysis of human plasma proteins.</p>
<p><strong>3. Separation across two dimensions:</strong></p>
<p><strong>3.1 First dimension:</strong></p>
<p>Each protein has a specific isoelectric point (pI), at which it gains net neutral charge. This property is used for separation of proteins on the first dimension of 2DE. During IEF, the proteins with different charges move across the pH gradient strip due to the applied electric field. They come to rest at a position where their net charge is zero and they can no longer migrate in the electric field. Initially tube gels were used for first dimension separation in which a pH gradient was established using a suitable ampholyte solution consisting of low molecular weight organic acids and bases components. These pH gradients were not very stable having tendency to breakdown upon application of concentrated samples thereby leading to a lot of variations and very less reproducibility in the results. The issues were resolved by replacing the tube gels with immobilized pH gradient (IPG) strips. IPG strips make use of immobulins that are co-polymerized with the gel and therefore eliminate the errors related to IEF separation. A wide range pH gradients on polyacrylamide gels are available commercially that can be selected depending on the complexity of sample to be used in the experiment. This innovative concept of IPG strips was developed by a German scientist, Angelika G&ouml;rg. (Figure 3).</p>

<p><strong>3.2 Second dimension:</strong></p>
<p>The second dimension separation in 2DE involves SDS-PAGE, a commonly employed technique that separates molecules based on their molecular weights. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) is an anionic detergent that denatures the proteins and confers them with a uniform negative charge proportional to their molecular weight. This ensures that the charge-to-mass ratio of all proteins is nearly identical thereby facilitating separation completely on the basis of their molecular weights. The polyacrylamide gel is prepared using acrylamide and bisacrylamide as the cross-linkers for the polymerization reaction, which is aided by ammonium persulfate (APS), while N,N,N',N'-Tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED) acts as a free radical supplier to facilitate the reaction in presence of tris-HCl and SDS solution. The gels casted forms the base for loading the focused IPG strips used in the 1st dimension, the whole gel setup is placed in the electrophoresis unit containing running buffer solution. Application of an electric field results migration of the proteins through the gel based entirely on their molecular weights. Once electrophoretic separation get completed, the proteins are stained with routinely used staining agents like coomassie blue and silver that allows the visualization of the separated protein spots. More recently, different fluorescent stains such as SYPRO Ruby Red, SYPRO Orange, Deep Purple, CyDye etc. have been developed, which allow for extremely sensitive detection of even very minute amounts of proteins.</p>

<p>2DE has the ability to separate around 2000 proteins simultaneously in a single run, which makes it a highly effective and versatile tool to study relative protein concentrations in complex protein mixtures (Figure 5). This gel-based proteomic approach serves as a separation technique for resolving large numbers of proteins, and acts as an effective profiling tool to monitor relative abundances of the proteins through appropriate staining procedures. 2DE is widely applied to study proteome profiles that portray alterations in protein expression level, isoforms or post-translational modifications.</p>

<p>However, comparative analysis of multiple samples using 2DE found to be challenging, since only one sample could be resolved per gel. Gel-to-gel variations, manual artifacts, system variations, and lack of reproducibility made it difficult to compare gel patterns when samples (test and control) are resolved on two different gels. The requirement for a stable and robust method which could overcome this hurdle led to the introduction of difference gel electrophoresis (DIGE), developed by Mustafa Unlu and his group in1997. This technique allows the separation and detection of up to three different protein mixtures on a single 2DE gel. It enabled researchers to study the relative expression of samples with respect to varied biological conditions such as disease, treated, post/pre treatment with high reproducibility. 2D-DIGE uses fluorescent cyanine dyes, Cy2, Cy3 and Cy5 (wavelength of ~488, ~532 and ~642 respectively), each having a specific excitation energy and wavelength that enables the accurate detection of the proteins labeled with each dye. Two different samples (test and control) are labeled with either of Cy3 and Cy5, while a pool of samples in equal quantity known as &ldquo;internal standard&rdquo; is labeled with Cy2. All the labeled samples are mixed together to run on a single gel. The internal standard is used to overcome gel-to-gel, manual, system and experimental variations. Application of the pooled internal standard having all the proteins from each experimental group minimizes any variability that may arise in the gel, thereby providing an efficient and accurate technique for protein profiling. Once separation of proteins takes place across the two different dimensions, the gel is scanned and visualized at different wavelengths allowing the comparative analysis of the relative expression patterns based on the spot intensity. The gel images are analyzed using advanced software which accurately quantifies the differential expression of many proteins between test and control samples on a single gel.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 6.</strong>Pictorial depiction of a typical 2D-DIGE experiment, two different samples for the study are labeled with either of Cy3 and Cy5 and pool of these two samples in equal quantity is labeled with Cy2. Once the labeling reaction is completed, all the three labeled samples are pooled together to carry out 1st and 2nd dimensions separation of the labeled proteins. After electrophoretic separation 2D-DIGE gels are scanned employing suitable excitation/emission wavelengths for each of the CyDye [Cy3 (523/580 nm), Cy5 (633/670 nm) and Cy2 (488/520 nm)].</p>

<p><strong>Human serum proteome</strong></p>
<p>Serum is a complex biological fluid containing few highly abundant proteins and many low abundance proteins. Studies have shown that there are around 20 high abundance proteins in serum, which usually decrease the resolution and tend to mask the presence of other low abundance proteins. Albumin and immunoglobulin G (IgG) account for a very large fraction of the overall protein contents of serum. In order to obtain effective separation on 2DE, it is ideal to remove these highly abundant proteins from serum prior to electrophoresis process.</p>

<p>Removal of these high abundance proteins is usually carried out with the help of commercially available kits, which work on the basic principle of affinity chromatography. The columns present in the commercial kits are packed with affinity beads that are capable of binding specifically to high abundance proteins. High abundance proteins, which need to be removed, bind to the surface of the beads, while proteins of interest (other than albumin and IgG) elute out of the column by changing the pH of the buffer. Serum depletion can also be performed using size exclusion criterion wherein molecular cut-off columns are used. These columns retain the proteins that are above its cut-off range but release the lower molecular weight proteins. For example, a molecular cut-off column of 60 kDa will trap albumin having a molecular weight of 66 kDa. The whole procedure of 2-DE can be subdivided into the following 4 steps, each of which will be described in detail.</p>

<li>Sample Collection and Preparation</li>

</ol>
<p><strong>1) Sample Collection and Preparation</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.A - Sample Collection</strong></p>
<p>Blood is composed of different types of blood cells and plasma. The plasma acts as a suspension liquid for blood cells and other biological molecules. Plasma that is deprived of coagulation factors is referred to as serum and contains all circulatory proteins except fibrinogen and other clotting factors. The collection of blood and separation of serum for proteomics experiments is the first crucial step that influences the result and reproducibility of the experiment. Proper care during sample handling prevents the denaturing of proteins in serum</p>
<p>Sample collection is carried out as described below.</p>
<ul type="circle">
<li>Around 5 ml of intravenous blood is collected into a commercially available blood collection tube, which does not contain any external anti-coagulating agent. The Vacutainer tubes are commonly used to bring about efficient and rapid withdrawal of blood.</li>
<li>Immediately after collection, the tube is placed on ice for 30 min. This incubation time is required to bring about coagulation of the blood and formation of the fibrin clot, which is essential to separate the serum.</li>
<li>The serum is then separated by centrifuging the coagulated blood sample at 2500 rpm at 20&deg;C for 10 min. The blood clot containing the different types of blood cells and clotting factors forms the pellet while the serum forms the supernatant.</li>
<li>The dark, yellowish, viscous supernatant is then carefully aspirated out using a micropipette and collected into a fresh, clean, labeled microcentrifuge tube. Care should be taken not to disturb the pellet.</li>
<li>Usually, about 1.5-2 ml of serum can be collected per 5 ml of whole blood.</li>
<li>The tube containing the serum is then labeled appropriately and stored at -80&deg;C until further use.</li>
