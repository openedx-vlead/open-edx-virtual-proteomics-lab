<p><br /><strong>DATA ANALYSIS</strong></p>
<p>It is essential to a analyze the 2-DE gels in order to draw any conclusion about proteome level changes. Analysis is mostly done with the help of software which enables simultaneous comparison of enormous number of spots across various gels. Gels with proteins of various biological conditions such as diseased and healthy, drug treated and untreated can be analyzed to draw a conclusion about unique or differentially expressed proteins. Various links are provided will guide you over the analysis process. These files can be downloaded for use.</p>
<p>A) We have demonstrated the process of analyzing gel using a simulation. This simulation guides you to get a real tome feel of data analysis pattern. You may click HERE to get an access to the simulator. Following are details of the simulation;</p>
<ul type="circle">
<li>Make match set: This option creates a match between gels. After option is enabled the window displays similar spots over 2 gels. Now one may proceed with getting further information on spots.</li>
<li>Spot ID: Tracking each spots in the gel on the course of analysis iS made easy be designating each spot with a spot ID. For knowing spot ID of a particular spot, please click on the desired spot and press the button of spot ID. This displays the spot ID of clicked spot and also the corresponding spot in matching gel.</li>
<li>Molecular weight &amp; pH: Molecular weight &amp; pH of the spot can be displayed by clicking on a spot and followed by clicking the molecular weight option.</li>
<li>Spot intensity: This is a quantitative measurement of protein across the spots. This is a relative figure value obtained can be further used for statistical analysis.</li>
<li>Intensity comparison: This is a graphical representation of differences in the intensities. To enable the option, click on the desired spot then click on the option.</li>
<li>3-D view: Each spot on the gel can be visualized in a 3D manner. This option displays the intensity of spot in as a peak. Smoothness of the peak depicts the goodness of the spot. This also helps for differentiate between false and original spots.</li>
<li>Fold change: This option helps the user to conclude on whether or not the spot is differentially is expressed. The fold change number indicates the changes in the protein expression level across the two different biological conditions. Option 9 will display all three options of Intensity comparison 3-D view and Fold change simultaneously.</li>
</ul>
<p>B) Out put of all three experiments are (3 gel pairs, 2 different biological conditions) available for download in the DOWNLOAD section of the website.</p>
<p>C) Various companies provide analysis softwares on a trial use basis. One may download these software for practicing the analysis of provided 2-DE gel images.</p>
<p>D) You may click to get demonstration on analysis:-Analysis Demonstration.ppt . Analysis is done using one of the commercially available softwares. The power point presentation guides in all the steps right from uploading of the gel till getting the final out put of differential expression.</p>
<p>Result: Comparison of control and drug treated bacterial proteome will reveal the proteome level alterations as a consequence of drug treatment. Differential expression between the gels (control and drug treated) can be studied by comparing intensities of various spots thereby knowing which protein get up-regulated or down-regulated. In addition to the comparison between test and control, a match set can be created for all the gels which will provide an understanding into number of spots that are different across the gels , by what percentage they vary in other parameters like intensity, size etc. Differentially expressed protein spots in drug treated samples identified in 2DE analysis can be subjected to MS analysis to reveal the identity of the proteins. Details of MS analysis using MALDI-TOF MS have been described in the next module.</p>
