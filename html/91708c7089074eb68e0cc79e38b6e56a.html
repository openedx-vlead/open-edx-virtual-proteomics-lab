<h4>Instructors&rsquo; assignment:</h4>
<p>Course instructors should explain the basic theory of MALDI-TOF and play the animation in class before providing the detailed experimental protocol. Once the students become familiar with the overall procedure they can be evaluated through the related questions provided under &ldquo;Quiz&rdquo; and &ldquo;Assignment&rdquo; sections.</p>
<h4>Assignment for students:</h4>
<p>Students are requested to click on the simulator window to run the animation and there are provisions for the learners to participate actively in the over-all MALDI-TOF instrumentation process by clicking on the equipments etc. using the computer mouse during the different steps of the instrumentation process. Students are strongly advised to go through the references provided in &ldquo;Reference&rdquo; section for further knowledge.</p>
