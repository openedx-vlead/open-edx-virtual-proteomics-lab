<h4>Instructors&rsquo; assignment:</h4>
<p>Course instructors should explain the basic principle and necessity of each steps associated with MALDI sample preparation and play the animation in class before providing the detailed experiment protocol. Once the students become familiar with the overall procedure they can be evaluated through the related questions provided under &ldquo;Quiz&rdquo; and &ldquo;Assignment&rdquo; sections.</p>
<h4>Assignment for students:</h4>
<p>Students can click on simulator window to run the animation and there are provisions for the learners to participate actively for different steps of MS sample preparation by using interactive animations. Students can click on micropipettes, reagents, equipments etc. using the computer mouse during different steps of the experiment. Students should read the references provided in &ldquo;Reference&rdquo; section to further advance their knowledge.</p>
