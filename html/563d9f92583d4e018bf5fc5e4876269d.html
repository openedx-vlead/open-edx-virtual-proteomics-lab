<p>Proteins are complex bio-molecules with wide range of physiological functions in all living organisms. Various techniques have been developed over the last few decades by many researchers to study the structure and functions of proteins. Amongst all of the commonly used techniques, electrophoresis has been referred to as &lsquo;Gold Standard&rsquo; due to its ability to provide much more information about protein properties. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) is one of the most widely used electrophoretic techniques for separation of complex mixtures of proteins. In 2DE, protein separation is carried out based on two different properties of proteins namely, isoelectric point and molecular weight. With the passage of time several advancements have been introduced in the separation procedure to increase the sensitivity, robustness and efficiency.</p>
<p>1. Properties of proteins and separation</p>
<p>Proteins are biologically vital, complex biomolecules that possess a very wide range of functions compared to the other biomolecules. They possess dynamic physical and chemical properties which are largely dependent on their composition and structure. Unlike DNA, they do not possess uniform negative charge, which makes a very challenging task for studying these molecules using regular, conventional biochemical techniques. Proteins are long, polymeric, macromolecules made up of amino acid residues. Amino acids are molecules containing an amino group, a carboxylic acid group and an aliphatic or aromatic side chain that varies between different amino acids (Figure 1).</p>

<p>The amino acid side chain, referred to as the R group, varies across the different amino acids, and thereby resulting in differences in properties for the various amino acids. The presence of acidic carboxylic acid group and basic amino group confers amino acids with an amphoteric nature i.e. the ability to behave as acids or bases. This results in amino acids bearing a different net charge depending upon pH of the surrounding environment. This property is utilized as one of the separation criteria for protein mixtures. Proteins have multiple structural levels; the primary structure consists of the linear arrangement of amino acids that are joined together by means of peptide bonds. The polypeptide backbone of the protein undergoes folding due to the formation of several internal bonds which gives rise to the secondary structure. Further interactions between the side chains of the amino acid residues and interactions between multiple polypeptide chains (subunit) lead to the tertiary and quaternary structures respectively.</p>

<p><strong>2. History and Development from electrophoresis</strong></p>
<p>Electrophoresis was invented by Prof. Arne Wilhelm Kaurin Tiselius; a Swedish scientist in 1930, for which he received the Nobel Prize in chemistry in the year of 1948. The concept of electrophoresis initially developed by him involved free solution and was termed as &ldquo;moving boundary electrophoresis&rdquo;. Reports of using filter papers and gels in electrophoresis were first seen only in early 1950 and rapid developments ensured electrophoresis to become a widely adopted technique by 1960 and later on.</p>
